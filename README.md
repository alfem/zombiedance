Zombie Dance


Have you got one of those dance mats?

Have you noticed the only game for it is Dance Dance Revolution?

Do you dance like a drunken duck?

if you answer 'yes' to these questions, Zombie Dance is what you need.


The Game

Zombie Dance is quite simple: zombies come out of the ground trying to eat you. And you step on them to take them back to hell.

When you kill five zombies, game speed increases.

Playing. A couple of zombies are coming up. The orange frame points at the square you are stepping on.

When you jump on a zombie the score increases.

When a zombie is completely out of the ground (like the one below) you get injured, loosing one point of damage. When you run out of points, you are dead!



Controls

Use your dance mat to step on zombies.

Press <ESC> to quit game (anytime).

Press <Spacebar> (in the scoreboard screen) to restart.


Download and Installation

Go to files section to download the latest version.

Install pygame package from your favourite linux distribution.

Connect your dancemat (or a joystick, if just want to test the game)

Uncompress the compressed file in a folder, and run zombie-dance.

Wait for the zombies and jump!

A little bit of hacking

This game is free (as in freedom) software, so feel free to change everything.

Edit Gui.py to change the game background, or the zombies graphics. You can take a photo of your boss, your ex-wife, or your dog and have a great time stepping on them :-)

I don't know if every mat works like mine. If yours have a different key layout, change the array self.keymap in Gui.py. You can change it to use a joystick instead of a dance mat (for debugging purposes).
